# HurstBurst - Self-Similar Traffic Software Generator
## About HurstBurst
This software is part of my Master's thesis **"Development of traffic generator with given degree of self-similar"**.
It uses [client-server model](http://qt-doc.ru/model-klient-server.html), so in this way it consits of two parts:
+ [server part](https://github.com/svetloffyaroslav/HurstBurst/tree/master/tcp_server);
+ [client part](https://github.com/svetloffyaroslav/HurstBurst/tree/master/tcp_hurst).

Both programms are used to organize connection between two computers, and after than start to send traffic with different parameters, like:
* number of tcp-packages;
* size of every packets;
* types of distributions and their criterions (Like [Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), [Weibull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution), etc);

The scheme of expirements:
