# HurstBurst - Self-Similar Traffic Software Generator
## About HurstBurst
This software is part of my Master's thesis **"Development of traffic generator with given degree of self-similar"**.
It uses [client-server model](http://qt-doc.ru/model-klient-server.html), so in this way it consits of two parts:
+ server part;
+ client part.

Both programms are used to organize connection between two computers, and after than start to send traffic with different parameters.
